    <p>The fashion industry contributes to climate change at every stage, from production to the end of a garment’s life cycle. Carbon emissions are generated throughout the process—from growing raw materials like cotton to manufacturing, distribution, and disposal—all of which consume large amounts of energy. Growing conventional cotton has a large environmental burden as well; according to WWF, a single cotton T-shirt requires around 6,000 pounds of water to manufacture—nearly two and a half years’ worth of drinking water (García, 2025). Synthetic materials like polyester significantly contribute to carbon pollution due to their high energy consumption, non-biodegradable nature, and microplastics that shed into the environment.    </p>

    <p>Thrifting extends the life of clothes, decreasing the need for new production. This reduces carbon emissions, water usage, and the pollution caused by textile manufacturing. In the United States, 12.46 million tons of textiles are thrown into landfills each year, accounting for 7.7% of all landfill waste (Igini, 2024). By thrifting and participating in a circular economy, individuals help reduce waste, lower demand for resource-intensive production, and extend the life cycle of clothing.    </p>

    <p>The constant cycle of trends has fundamentally altered the way consumers think about fashion. According to the Harvard Business Review, fashion trends used to last for decades, whereas now, influencer culture and constant consumption have shortened trends to just a few weeks (Khan, 2023). In a world where trends come and go at such a rapid pace, it is becoming more difficult for people to explore their own sense of style—and easier to give in to impulse purchases. Fast fashion brands chase quantity over quality. Thrifting allows you to discover your personal style, avoid the pressure of constantly shifting microtrends, and shop more sustainably.    </p>

    <p>While 55% of consumers express interest in buying sustainable clothing, 48% are unsure where or how to find it, and 42% remain confused about what truly qualifies clothing as sustainable (Genomatica, 2022). Nik’s Thrifts serves as a space to educate and inspire others to shop sustainably by helping to navigate NYC thrifting and raising awareness about the environmental impact of the fashion industry.</p>
