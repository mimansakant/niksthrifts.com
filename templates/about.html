    What’s up! I’m <strong>Nikki</strong>—I live in New York City and I’m utterly obsessed with thrifting. With an (almost) 100 % thrifted closet, second‑hand shopping is not only a hobby of mine but also a sustainable lifestyle choice.

  <p>For the past 3 years, I’ve worked to create what I like to call The New York City Secondhand Guide—a curated list of thrift, vintage, and secondhand stores across NYC.
    It provides a deep examination into each store’s vibe, style, price range, location, price range, and more.
   
   Whether you're new to thrifting or a seasoned pro, The New York City Secondhand Guide makes the hunt easy and exciting with an <strong>interactive map</strong> that lets you input your personal preferences—helping you discover stores perfectly tailored to your style, budget, location, and more.</p>

  <p>For years this holy grail list was sitting in my notes app. I loved sharing it  with friends and family but wanted to give it to a larger audience. I created Nik’s Thrifts in January 2025 with the hopes of helping the NYC community navigate all the thrift stores and shop sustainably. 

    From a young age, I’ve had a love for the environment, animals, and sustainability. I graduated from <strong>Lehigh University</strong> in 2024 with a major in Environmental Studies.</p>

  <p>With the rise of fast fashion, my passion for sustainable fashion arose. I’m currently a graduate student at <strong>Columbia University
  </strong> pursuing my Master of Science in Sustainability Management. I’m grateful for the opportunity to combine my love for the environment with my entrepreneurial mindset and creativity to drive meaningful change.

  <p>Thrifting is an adventure every time—you never know what hidden gems you’ll uncover. It’s a fun and exciting way to express yourself while supporting a <strong>sustainable lifestyle
  </strong>. Every find tells a story, and every purchase keeps clothes out of landfills.
